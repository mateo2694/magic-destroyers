# Magic Destroyers

🕹 This is a very simple yet fun to watch console game where Melee and Spellcaster teams fight each other in consecutive rounds.

🏆 Last team standing wins! You don't really know which team is gonna win til you run it. Tired of it? Add or remove characters from the initial list in the `Program.cs` file and pass in different starting levels to explore new results.

🌈 Console has different colors (cause why not?).

> **Remember:** Object Oriented Programming was the goal here. Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymorphism.
